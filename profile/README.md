## Hi there 👋

### Welcome to Morningside AI!


##### Who are we? 🌟
Welcome to the lab! We’re Morningside AI, a team of passionate idealists on a mission to blend the practical with the pioneering. We're dedicated to empowering businesses through AI automation while simultaneously pushing the limits of what AI can achieve.

#### Want to Collaborate? 👩‍💻👨‍💻
We're all about community, and we believe that brilliance is multiplied when shared. Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Fork, Clone, Branch**: Fork the repo to your GitHub account, clone it locally, and create a new branch for your awesome features.
2. **Commit with Intent**: Make your changes and commit them. Good commit messages are like the abstract of a research paper—informative and concise.
3. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to our main branch, and our team will review your contribution.

#### Guiding Ideas
- **Alan Turing's Untold Story**: Beyond his contributions to computer science, Alan Turing was also a pioneer in the field of morphogenesis, the biological study of shapes and forms in nature. A reminder that cross-disciplinary knowledge can drive groundbreaking innovations.
- **Quantum Quirks**: Quantum computers use the principles of superposition to perform multiple calculations at once. This revolutionary technology has the potential to redefine what's possible in AI—and we’re keeping an eye on it.
- **Neural Networks & Nature**: Inspired by the human brain, neural networks are just one example of how understanding natural systems can provide computational solutions. Our approach often involves mimicking these systems for innovative solutions.
- **Butterfly Effect**: Coined by Edward Lorenz, this concept proves that small changes can lead to significant impacts. It’s a principle that keeps us attentive to every detail, no matter how minor it appears.
- **Pareto Principle**: Also known as the 80/20 rule, this principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. We apply this principle to our work by focusing on the 20% of our efforts that will yield 80% of the results.
- **The Golden Ratio in Design**: The golden ratio is a mathematical ratio that’s commonly found in nature and used in design. We use this ratio to create aesthetically pleasing designs that are also functional and intuitive.
- **Ada Lovelace's Vision**: Ada Lovelace was the first computer programmer, and she envisioned that computers could be used for more than just calculations. We share her vision of using computers to solve complex problems and create new possibilities.
