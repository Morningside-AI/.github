### Guiding Ideas
- **Alan Turing's Untold Story**: Beyond his contributions to computer science, Alan Turing was also a pioneer in the field of morphogenesis, the biological study of shapes and forms in nature. A reminder that cross-disciplinary knowledge can drive groundbreaking innovations.
- **Neural Networks & Nature**: Inspired by the human brain, neural networks are just one example of how understanding natural systems can provide computational solutions. Our approach often involves mimicking these systems for innovative solutions.
- **Butterfly Effect**: Coined by Edward Lorenz, this concept proves that small changes can lead to significant impacts. Itâ€™s a principle that keeps us attentive to every detail, no matter how minor it appears.
- **Pareto Principle**: Also known as the 80/20 rule, this principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. We apply this principle to our work by focusing on the 20% of our efforts that will yield 80% of the results.
